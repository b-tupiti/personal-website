From Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), which provides virtualized computing resources, to Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), which allows users to access software applications via the internet, cloud computing makes it easier to access the tools and capabilities required for various industries. Furthermore, with Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), developers can build, test, and deploy applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure."
